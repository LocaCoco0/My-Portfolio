      <h4 class="text-center">Our Mission</h4>
        <p>At Steep Hill Coffee Co-op we believe that every sip of coffee should be a conscious choice towards a better world. We are deeply committed to ethical sourcing, ensuring that our coffee beans are not only of exceptional quality but are also procured with utmost respect for the environment and the people who grow them. We work directly with small-scale farmers and cooperatives in various regions, forging long-term relationships based on fair trade principles. By prioritizing sustainability and social responsibility, we strive to create a positive impact on the lives of coffee farmers and their communities.</p>
				<p>Worker ownership is at the core of our values. We understand the significance of empowering those who contribute to the creation of our exquisite coffee. As a collective, we foster an inclusive environment where every team member has a voice and a stake in our success. By embracing a worker-owned model, we ensure that decision-making power and profits are shared equitably among all employees. This approach not only motivates our team to deliver excellence in every cup but also fosters a sense of ownership and pride in the work we do.</p>
				<p>We are advocates of direct trade, which enables us to establish direct connections with coffee farmers around the globe. By cutting out unnecessary intermediaries, we eliminate exploitation and create a more transparent and mutually beneficial relationship. Through direct trade, we can ensure that farmers receive fair compensation for their hard work and dedication. This approach also allows us to gain firsthand knowledge about the origins of our coffee, fostering a deeper appreciation for the craftsmanship and the unique flavors that each region brings to the cup. We are committed to providing you with an exceptional coffee experience while contributing to a more sustainable and equitable coffee industry.</p>
